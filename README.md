# iOSPointMapper
iOS application that collects standardized information for accurate mapping of outdoor sidewalks, frontages and indoor spaces

## To run the application

1. Clone the repository

2. Inside the [Frameworks](Frameworks/) folder, add the required frameworks

- OpenCV: https://opencv.org/releases/\
Download OpenCV â€“ 4.10.0 "iOS Pack".
Unzip and add the XCFramework file to [Frameworks](Frameworks/)


Note: While adding the frameworks, Xcode may not recognize the framework. In that case, you can add the framework manually by following the steps below:
- Remove the existing framework reference from the Xcode project navigator
- Drag and drop the framework file to the Xcode project navigator
- In the dialog that appears, make sure the "Copy items if needed" checkbox is checked and the target is selected
- Click Finish
- Go to the project settings -> General -> Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content
- Change the Embed status of the framework to "Embed & Sign"
- Clean the project and build again

3. Open the `IOSAccessAssessment.xcodeproj` file in Xcode

4. Select the target device (iOS device or simulator) and run the application
