# iOSPointMapper Machine Learning

This directory contains the machine learning models and related resources used in the iOSPointMapper project. The models are designed to assist in mapping points of interest on iOS devices using advanced machine learning techniques.

Currently, most of the models are not added to the project directly in the Github repository due to their size. Instead, they will be available later through a dedicated download link.

Currently, only the following models are included in the repository:
- Semantic Segmentation Models:
    - BiSeNetV2 (`bisenetv2_11_640_640.mlpackage`): A lightweight and efficient model for real-time semantic segmentation tasks. This is the main model used for segmenting images into different classes.
    - ESPNetv2 (`espnetv2_pascal_256.mlmodel`): This is currently not used in the app but is included for reference. It is another model that was previously used for semantic segmentation tasks.
